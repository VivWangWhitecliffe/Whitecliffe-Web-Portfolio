            <h1>MY STORY</h1>
            <p>Hi! I'm Deepti Joshi. Each of my creations were born out of creative curiosity. There was a need to express each idea and so, one of my first creative outlets was photographs.</p>
            <p>It spilled into a variety of exciting creations, such as embroidered bags, puzzle games, wall hangings, painted trikets, handmade tea infusers and finally custom made, carefully crafted earrings.</p>
            <p>I have the pleasure of presenting each one of my pieces here for you to purchase and enjoy. I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed making them. </p>
